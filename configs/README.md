# Homelab Configs

This folder contains example configurations used in my homelab.  
All files are **anonymized** and safe to share.

- `nginx.conf` – reverse proxy for Plex and Nextcloud  
- `docker-compose.yml` – Docker stack for core apps  
- `unifi-firewall.json` – sample firewall segmentation rules  

These configs demonstrate knowledge of **reverse proxying, container orchestration,  
and network segmentation** in a self-hosted environment.
