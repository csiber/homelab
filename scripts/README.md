# Homelab Scripts

This folder contains helper scripts I use in my homelab to  
automate common sysadmin tasks.

- `backup.sh` – backup Docker volumes and configs  
- `docker-cleanup.sh` – clean up unused Docker resources  
- `monitor.sh` – quick system health check  

All scripts are written to be simple, portable, and easy to extend.
