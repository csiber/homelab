# Homelab Documentation

Welcome to my **Homelab Documentation**.  
This site describes my personal infrastructure setup,  
covering servers, networking, containers, and integrations.  

The goal of this homelab is to provide:  
- A safe environment for testing and learning  
- Reliable self-hosted services for daily use  
- A foundation for experimenting with automation and cloud-native workflows
